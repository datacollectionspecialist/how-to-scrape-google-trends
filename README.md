## Frequently Asked Questions
**Q1: How accurate is the data from Google Trends Scraping API?**

The data retrieved from the Google Trends Scraping API is very reliable as it reflects actual search interest data from Google. However, keep in mind that trends are based on relative search interest over a period of time and may not always be accurate in terms of search volume. The API ensures that the data is up-to-date and provides insights into keyword popularity and trends across different regions, time periods, and categories.

**Q2: Can I scrape Google Trends data for any location and time range?**

Yes, Google Trends Scraper allows users to scrape data from almost any location and time range. You can customize the parameters, filter trends based on a specific area (country, state or even city), and set the desired time range to capture daily, weekly or even historical data for trend analysis.

**Q3: How to avoid being blocked while scraping Google Trends data?**

- **IP Rotation:** Use proxy servers or VPNs to rotate IP addresses regularly. This prevents the scraper from sending too many requests from a single IP, which could trigger Google's rate-limiting measures.
- **Rate Limiting:** Implement a delay between each request to avoid overwhelming Googleâ€™s servers and triggering security mechanisms.
- **User-Agent Rotation:** Rotate the User-Agent string to mimic requests from different devices and browsers, reducing the chances of detection.
- **Use Headless Browsers:** If possible, use [headless browsers](https://www.scrapeless.com/en/product/scraping-browser) that simulate real user behavior to further reduce the likelihood of being flagged.
